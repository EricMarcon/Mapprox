  abstract = {To study the detailed location patterns of industries, and particularly the tendency for industries to cluster relative to overall manufacturing, we develop distance-based tests of localization. In contrast to previous studies, our approach allows us to assess the statistical significance of departures from randomness. In addition, we treat space as continuous instead of using an arbitrary collection of geographical units. This avoids problems relating to scale and borders. We apply these tests to an exhaustive U.K. data-set. For four-digit industries, we find that (i) 52\% of them are localized at a 5\% confidence level, (ii) localization mostly takes place at small scales below 50 km, (iii) the degree of localization is very skewed, and (iv) industries follow broad sectoral patterns with respect to localization. Depending on the industry, smaller establishments can be the main drivers of both localization and dispersion. Three-digit sectors show similar patterns of localization at small scales as well as a tendency to localize at medium scales.}

  abstract = {We discuss a property of distance-based measures that has not been addressed with regard to evaluating the geographic concentration of economic activities. The article focuses on the choice between a probability density function of point-pair distances or a cumulative function. We begin by introducing a new cumulative function, M, for evaluating the relative geographic concentration and the co-location of industries in a non-homogeneous spatial framework. Secondly, some rigorous comparisons are made with the leading probability density function of Duranton and Overman (2005), Kd. The merits of the simultaneous use of Kd and M is proved, underlining the complementary nature of the results they provide.}

Our contribution presents the state of the art of distance-based methods employed in economic geography and which are also used in ecology. Topographic functions such as Ripley's K, absolute functions such as Duranton and Overman's Kd and relative functions such as Marcon and Puech's M are implemented. Their confidence envelopes (including global ones) and tests against counterfactuals are included in the package.}

  abstract = {Despite representing a very accurate method for assessing spatial distribution, Marcon and Puech's               M               has been insufficiently exploited so far, most likely because its computation relies on pairing every point of interest (i.e., firms, plants) with every other point within the area under analysis. Such a figure rapidly grows to unmanageable levels when said area is larger than a neighborhood or when every industry is taken into account. Consequently, practical applications of               M               have been exclusively experimental and circumscribed to very limited areas or to a handful of industries. This seems much regrettable since               M               provides many advantages compared to conventional measures of spatial distribution and also to alternative distance measures. In this article, we assess the reliability of using small administrative units instead of exact postal addresses for the localization of plants, in order to reduce               M               's computational burden. Working with a dataset that provides the location, the specific industry and the number of employees for every single plant/establishment in Italy for both manufacturing and services, we can also draw a preliminary but certainly interesting picture of Sardinia's economic geography and its development through the Great Recession toughest years between 2007 and 2012.},
